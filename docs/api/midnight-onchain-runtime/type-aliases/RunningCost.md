# Type Alias: RunningCost

```ts
type RunningCost: {
  bytesDeleted: bigint;
  bytesWritten: bigint;
  computeTime: bigint;
  readTime: bigint;
};
```

A running tally of synthetic resource costs.

## Type declaration

### bytesDeleted

```ts
bytesDeleted: bigint;
```

### bytesWritten

```ts
bytesWritten: bigint;
```

The number of (modelled) bytes written.

### computeTime

```ts
computeTime: bigint;
```

The amount of (modelled) time spent in single-threaded compute, measured in picoseconds.

### readTime

```ts
readTime: bigint;
```
